    'From an early age I was always interested in computing, with age this interest has evolved into a genuine passion. Building software/stuff that solves a genuine problem is the main criteria for any project I undertake.',
    'I would describe myself as keen, open to ideas and hungry for knowledge; When I’m not at work trying to build/fix something you will probably find me reading up on how to build better software; That or developing upon personal projects. I have been very lucky with all of my positions to date; I have been exposed to every level of application development & delivery. I feel this has given me what I would consider to be an advantage over most. Luckily I realised early on in my carer that programming is only one segment of a project’s pipeline, Good communication and co-ordination can elevate a good project into greatness.'
